# Insight data science project

* For Insight Data Science Fellowship program, I worked as a consultant for a company that provides services to farmers for crop harvest efficiency and farm management using machine learning algorithms.
* Due to the proprietary nature of the company data and API, I have intentionally omitted the parts that involves data collection and the scripts using the company's API.
* Therefore, some libraries used in this Jupyter notebook are not publicly available for download and review.
